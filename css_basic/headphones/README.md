# Web Page Design Implementation
## Description
This project is an implementation of a web page design based on a Figma project. The design is responsive and switches to a mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.

## Design Decisions
The design utilizes a clean and modern aesthetic, with a focus on typography and whitespace. The color scheme is simple, with a bold accent color (#FF6565) used for links and hover states. The font used is Source Sans Pro, with Spin Cycle OT used for specific design elements.

## Technical Details
The web page is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is responsive and uses CSS media queries to switch to a mobile version at 480px or less. Links and buttons have hover and active states, implemented using CSS pseudo-classes.
